                In this test, you'll listen to both a reference voice sample and the voice sample for evaluation.
                Your task is to assess the similarity between the speakers of these two voice samples.
                Concentrate solely on determining how closely related the speakers sound, disregarding content, prosody, and quality differences between the voices.
                A score closer to 5 suggests a higher similarity in speaker identity between the two voices.<br><br>
            </p>
            <strong>Note: </strong>It's highly recommended to wear headphones or a headset and to be in a quiet environment for precise assessment.
