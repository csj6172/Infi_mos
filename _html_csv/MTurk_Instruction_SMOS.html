                In this test, you'll listen to both a reference voice sample and the voice sample for evaluation.
                Your task is to assess the similarity between the speakers of these two voice samples.
                Concentrate solely on determining how closely related the speakers sound, disregarding content, prosody, and quality differences between the voices.
                A score closer to 5 suggests a higher similarity in speaker identity between the two voices.<br><br>
            </p>
            <strong>Note1: </strong>It is imperative that we ask you to please listen to the audio recordings in its entirety when rating it.<br>
            <strong>Note2: </strong>In order to distinguish any instances of cheating, we have inserted a few extremely abnormal sounds among the audio recordings. If you are not able to accurately assign 1 point ratings to these instances, your ratings may be entirely rejected.<br>
            <strong>Note3: </strong>It's highly recommended to wear headphones or a headset and to be in a quiet environment for precise assessment.<br>
            <strong>Note4: </strong>Among the samples we have prepared, there may be a Korean reference audio for cross-lingual task. Please do not mind the language and only evaluate it according to the given instructions.<br>
            <strong>Note5: </strong>If you need example for scoring, please see below "More instructions" tab.
