                In this test, you'll listen to voice samples and rate the quality on a scale of 1 to 5.
                A score closer to 5 implies higher quality of the voice.
                Please consider the naturalness of speech, pronunciation accuracy, and overall sound quality when assigning your rating.<br><br>
            </p>
            <strong>Note: </strong>It's highly recommended to wear headphones or a headset and to be in a quiet environment for precise assessment.
