                In this test, you'll listen to voice samples and rate the quality on a scale of 1 to 5.<br>
                Please consider the naturalness of speech, accuracy of pronunciation, and overall sound quality (the absence or existence of sound distortions) when assigning your rating.<br><br>
                A score closer to 5 implies a higher quality of the voice.<br>

            <li>It is imperative that we ask you to please listen to the audio recordings in its entirety when rating it.</li><br>
            <li>In order to distinguish any instances of cheating, we have inserted a few extremely abnormal sounds among the audio recordings. If you are not able to accurately assign 1 point ratings to these instances, your ratings may be entirely rejected.</li><br>
            <li>It's highly recommended to wear headphones or a headset and to be in a quiet environment for precise assessment.</li><br>
