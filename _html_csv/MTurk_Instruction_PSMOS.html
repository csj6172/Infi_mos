                In this test, your job is to evaluate the prosody similarity between a reference voice sample and an evaluation voice sample.
                Focus solely on assessing how similar the prosody—intonation, rhythm, and stress patterns—sounds between the two samples.
                Please disregard differences in content, speaker identity, and overall quality.
                A rating closer to 5 indicates a higher similarity in prosody between the two voice samples.<br><br>
            </p>
            <strong>Note: </strong>It's highly recommended to wear headphones or a headset and to be in a quiet environment for precise assessment.
